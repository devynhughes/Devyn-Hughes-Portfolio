# Data Science Portfolio - Devyn Hughes

This repository contains a collection of data science projects and analyses that showcase my skills and abilities in data analysis, machine learning, modeling, data visualization, etc.

1. **Defense Against Pandemics using COVID**
   - Description: Using various tools of machine learning with CO-VID19 data from each country across the world, the project aims to try and learn trends to predict mortality rate and incidence rate based on a multitude of variables.
   - Tools Used: R
